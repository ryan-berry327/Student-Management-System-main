# Student Management System

This project is a Python-based **Student Management System** designed to manage students, courses, and teachers. It allows the management of student enrollment in courses, grade assignments, GPA calculations, and overall course summaries. The system supports multiple students, teachers, and courses.

## Features

- **Student Enrollment**: Enroll students in courses and track their grades.
- **Grade Management**: Assign grades to students for specific courses and calculate their GPA.
- **Course Management**: Create courses, assign teachers, and manage student enrollments.
- **Teacher Management**: Assign courses to teachers and allow them to manage student grades.
- **Student GPA Calculation**: Automatically calculate and update the GPA of students based on their grades.
- **Course Summaries**: Display details about courses, including the teacher, enrolled students, and average grades.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules that work together to provide a seamless experience.

### Modules

- **Person**: A base class for common attributes shared between students and teachers (name, age, ID).
- **Student**: Inherits from `Person` and adds functionality for managing courses, grades, and GPA calculations.
- **Teacher**: Inherits from `Person` and manages the assignment of courses and grades for students.
- **Course**: Manages course details, including enrollment, grade assignments, and course summaries.
- **Grade**: Handles grade assignment, grade updates, and determining whether a student is passing or failing.

## Usage

- **Enroll a Student**: Use the `enroll_student()` method in the `Course` class to enroll students in a specific course.
- **Assign Grades**: Use the `assign_grade()` method in the `Course` class or the `assign_grade()` method in the `Teacher` class to assign grades to students.
- **View Course Summary**: Use the `course_summary()` method in the `Course` class to view detailed information about the course, such as the teacher, number of students enrolled, and the average grade.
- **Calculate GPA**: Use the `calculate_gpa()` method in the `Student` class to calculate and view a student's GPA based on their enrolled courses and grades.
